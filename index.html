                                <p class="p_modal">Pikachu are small, chubby, and cute mouse-like Pokémon. They are almost completely covered by yellow fur. They have long yellow ears that are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its large tail is notable for being shaped like a lightning bolt. On its cheeks are two circle-shaped red pouches used for storing electricity. They turn yellow and spark with electricity when it's about to use an Electric attack, such as Thunderbolt. It has also been known to generate small surges of electrical energy in anger or for protection, like in the anime.They are usually friendly creatures that love to be cuddled. They love having their tails rubbed, especially at the base; they also like being stroked. However, if threatened or angered, this Pokémon can be quite aggressive. If someone pulls or steps on its tail, it is most likely it will bite or shock anyone in the area, including the one who pulled its tail.

                                    However in the anime and in the wild of the Kanto region they live in big groups deep in forests and are wary of humans.

                                    In Kanto according to Ash in PJ035, it also greet one another by shocking them and sometimes they'll gather up in big groups to search for Thunderstones so they can evolve.

                                    The Pikachu that live in the Pikachu Valley in Alola in the anime, greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Also, they can start duels with one another by sending electric signals and the winner is decided when the opponent's tail is bitten.


                                    It's special ability is Static, which can cause paralysis in battle if hit by a physical move. In Pokémon Black and White's Dream World, the Trainer receives a Pikachu with the Lightning Rod ability.

                                    They are capable of learning Volt Tackle, a powerful Electric-type physical move exclusive to the Pikachu family of Pokémon.

                                    Togepi is a Pokémon who appears to not have fully hatched out of its shell yet; only its head and stubby hands and feet appear out of its egg's shell. The parts of its body that appear are a pale, cream color, whereas the shell is predominantly white. Togepi's shell also has red and blue markings, shaped as triangles. Its head has five spikes that appear to form a crown, or when viewing on the top of its head to be look like a star shape-like. Its eyes are small, black, and oval-shaped. When about to cry, its eye color may turn into red.


                                    It is friendly and docile, and loves being around with children. If anyone protects or makes it happy, it will return the favor by sharing its own joy.

                                    However, it is always at risk of being forgotten during a crisis, so it needs extremely cautious protection by its guardians and trainers.


                                    It can release toxins from its head. It can retract its spikes when it sleeps. Sometimes it can absorb energies around it and transfer said energies to the needy.


                                    It evolves into Togetic when leveled up with max friendship, whom, in turn, will evolve into Togekiss in Generation IV onwards when exposed to a Shiny Stone.<br>

                                    Bulbasaur resembles a small amphibian/frog , but bears three claws on each of its feet and has no tail. It also has large, red eyes and small, sharp teeth. Its skin is a light, turquoise color with dark, green spots. It has three claws on all four of its legs. Its most notable feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which according to its entry in the Pokédex, was planted there at birth.

                                    It has a "bulb" on its back that grows steadily larger as it matures. This bulb contains a seed which uses photosynthesis to supply Bulbasaur with energy. Its bulb is also used to store the energy that the seed absorbs, which can be used when it is necessary. It is assumed that when a Bulbasaur collects enough energy in its bulb, it will evolve into an Ivysaur.


                                    It often rests in bright places so its bulb can absorb sunlight. It can be seen napping in bright sunlight. While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to grow.<br>

                                    Squirtle is a small, light-blue Pokémon with an appearance similar to a turtle. With its aerodynamic shape and grooved surface, Squirtle's shell helps it wade through the water very quickly. It also offers protection in battle. Like turtles, Squirtle has a shell that covers its body with holes that allow its limbs, tail, and head to be exposed. Unlike a turtle, Squirtle is ordinarily bipedal.
                                    Its shell is highly sturdy, so it can hide within its shell to protect itself from physical attacks.
                                    It is usually well behaved, yet it has an underlying rebellious streak. It likes to be open with only a limited number of people and won’t advertise its secrets. It prefers to stay within a close knit group, but can still enjoy making new friends. Other Pokémon may regard it as difficult and hard to get along with, but only if they have previously gotten on its bad side.<br>

                                    Meowth is a small, bipedal, feline Pokémon. It has two cream whiskers on each side of its oval-shaped face and two hairs sticking up on either side of the coin-like gem on its forehead. Meowth also has a curled tail. Meowth's tail and feet are cream-colored like the rest of it, but they are brown at the end. It has small paw pads on the undersides of its heels and toes. It is much like a Maneki Neko, a toy of Japanese descent known for bobbing its arm and hand up and down.


                                    It is largely nocturnal and often prowls the streets looking for loose change, as it is attracted to bright shiny objects for some unexplained reason. It always cleans its face to prevent its forehead coin from getting dirtied. It is common to witness Meowth ferociously disputing with Murkrow, which is also known for being equally obsessed with glowing things. Although it can be easily drawn by coins and may befriend people that offers them, its fickleness cannot guarantee such friendships will last; when it is feeling good, it will be willing to share a look of its hoarded treasures to its Trainer.
                                    In the anime, Team Rocket's Meowth is capable of human speech (a skill he learned while living on the street of Hollywood to impress a female Meowth named Meowzie).<br>

                                    It can have the ability Magic Guard or Cute Charm. Cute Charm allows Clefairy to have a 30% chance to infatuate the foe if the foe is the opposite gender and a physical attack hits Clefairy. Magic Guard allows Clefairy to only get damage by attacks. Clefairy can jump very high, as seen in the anime, and can hear very well. This is often the reason why they are hard to find. Clefairy collects moonlight in its wings and uses it to fly.

                                    It is very timid and rarely appears in front of humans. But it is very clever, and there are awareness among social and religious groups. Clefairy is a nocturnal Pokémon and will come out during the full moon to dance.<br>

                                <p class="p_modal">Psyduck resembles a yellow duck or platypus with a vacant stare. It has three small tufts of black hair at the top of its head. It walks on its hind legs, has a stubby tail, and has arms rather than wings, terminating in claws to deliver scratches if threatened. Its arms are useful in using its powerful psychic abilities. Its appearance,lifexis stupid and sexy [citation needed].

                                    Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache. It usually stands immobile, with a vacant expression, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, it releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers.

                                    Psyduck are usually unable to think very clearly due to having a chronic headaches. Because of the headache, a Psyduck will always hold its head. When these headaches worsen, Psyduck may use psychic powers.

                                <p class="p_modal">Gyarados is a large dragon Pokémon, resembling dragons seen in Chinese mythology. His serpentine body is mostly blue, but his underbelly and the spots along his body are yellow. He has a three-pointed, dark blue crest on his head and four white fins down his back. his mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four canine teeth, but bears some resemblance to that of his pre-evolution Magikarp. Like Magikarp, he has one barbel on both sides of his face. his pectoral and dorsal fins also resemble Magikarp's. Gyarados is rarely shown with his mouth closed. When Gyarados is forced to undergo evolution, he retains Magikarp's red coloring, leading to the phenomena of the Red Gyarados. his height is 21'04" and weight is 518.1 lbs.
                                    Like most dragon-like Pokémon, Gyarados' strength is mostly Template:Stat, causing it to rely more on physical attacks than special. It is one of the few Template:Type Pokémon able to wield both Fire and Electric attacks. Its fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Despite the strength of its fangs, it cannot learn the move Crunch and can only learn one of the elemental fang moves.
                                    This Pokémon bears little resemblance to its docile pre-evolution. Gyarados is infamously known for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies. Once it has worked itself into a frenzy, it will not calm until everything around it is destroyed; this tendency is attributed to the dramatic structural changes its brain undergoes during evolution. It seems attracted to violence. During times of human conflict, Gyarados are said to appear, burning entire cities down to the ground. In addition, Gyarados are also notoriously difficult to tame even after they are captured by the Trainer, usually requiring an exceptional amount of work in taming it until it can become loyal and obedient to its Trainer.
